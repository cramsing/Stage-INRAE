# Stage-INRAE

Repository to document all code for Charis' stage at INRAE

All code used to import data is found in the "data_import" file. Dataframes resulting from scripts in that folder are saved as "punch.RData", "rep1.RData", and "rep2.RData" in the main folder. These RData files can be downloaded and used to run the "master.R" script containing code for data anlysis (anova, kruskal wallis, post-hoc tests, etc.) as well as code for ggplots.
